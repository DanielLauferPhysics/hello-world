# hello-world
Greetings!

I'm a physicist with a strong interest in the mathematics behind networks and their generalisations (simplicial complexes, hypergraphs, etc), particularly with intersections between geometry and network theory. At the moment, I'm looking for resources on Helgason-Fourier transforms, MÃ¶bius transformations and the theory of metric space families, with the level of sophistication being geared towards someone who is unfamiliar with the material and has had introductory coursework consistent with an undergraduate maths student.
